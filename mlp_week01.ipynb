    "> You are asked to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). We will just call them “districts” for short.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> The next question to ask is **what the current solution looks like (if any)**. It will often give you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would be useful to train a model to predict a district’s median housing price given other data about that district. The census data looks like a great dataset to exploit for this purpose, since it includes the median housing prices of thousands of districts, as well as other data.\n",

    "Pipelines are very useful when we want to run data through our pipeline in the future; rather than having to copy and paste a load of code, we can just use our pipeline which combines all the steps. Later on the course, we will see this is important when we split our data into training, validation, and test sets, but this would also be required if you deploy your model in a \"live\" environment. In particular, pipelines  help prevent you from **data leakage**, i.e. when information from your testing data leaks into your training or model selection. **Data leakage** is a common reason why many ML models fail to generalize to real world data. Furthermore, when refining a model, pipelines makes it easier for us to add or remove steps of our pipeline to see what works and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its also worth examining what is meant by a **\"Pipeline\"**. A general definition is that it is just a sequence of data preparation operations that is ensured to be **reproducible**. Specifically, in sklearn,  `Pipeline` can contains a sequence of _transformer_ or _estimator_ classes, or, if we use an imbalanced-learn `Pipeline` instead, also _resamplers_. This week we have focused on _transformers_, but later on in the course we will learn about _estimators_ and _resamplers_. All three of these objects (_resamplers_, _transformers_, and _estimator_) all typically have a `.fit()` method. We have already seen examples of calling `.fit()` on _transformers_. The method works similarly on other classes and is used to\n",

    "\n",
    "Along with other sample properties (e.g. `sample_weight`), the `.fit()` method usually takes two inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The input matrix (or design matrix) $\\mathbf{X}$. The size of $\\mathbf{X}$ is typically (n_samples, n_features), which means that samples are represented as rows and features are represented as columns.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - The target values $\\mathbf{y}$ which are real numbers for regression tasks, or integers for classification (or any other discrete set of values). For unsupervised learning tasks, $\\mathbf{y}$ does not need to be specified. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html\n",

    "This week, our focus is combining different feature engineering steps together to make different model pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember we want to create a pipeline that treats the **numerical** and **categorical** attributes differently. \n",
